### How to Start Program
+ Run **Main.java** (located in default package of the source directory)

### How to Use Program/Configure Settings
1. Using the UI
	+ Pressing **Start** will run the last command with animation or continue running the command if pressed after Pause was pressed.
	+ Pressing **Stop** will stop the animation.
	+ Pressing **Pause** will pause the animation.
	+ User can change the animation speed (moving left will slow down speed, moving right will increase speed). 
	+ Pressing the run button will run everything written in the bottom editor box. Pressing clear will clear all the text in it. 

3. The rest of the program settings can be found on the help page, which is accessible via the drop-down help menu.

 
### Known Bugs
+ Pen properties of line type (dashed, dotted) do not work with animation. Animation also does not work for multiple turtles.

### Possible Improvements
+ Implementation of debugger and undo command
+ Better implementation of Animation that also works with pen line types and multiple turtles

### Data/Resources Required for Project
+ default turtle image file and all resources located in the resources package

### Additional Resources Consulted
+ Course Notes provided by Professor Duvall in the CS308 Website
